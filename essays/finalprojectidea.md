Happy Hour Finder
Overview (including “The problem” and “The solution”)
  Problem: Different restaurants and bars have happy hours at different times on different days. It can be hard to keep track of when you can get the cheapest deals on drinks and meals. Currently there is no easy way to find the best happy hours available to you and it can be a hassle think of places to even check. It would be much easier to find a place for you and your friends to get together if all of this information was available in one location.

  Solution: The Happy Hour Finder can help you locate the various happy hour spots available to you right now. When you and your friends meet up you won't have to waste your free time deliberating on the location. Now you and your friends can simply open up the webpage and see which restaurants close to you are offering pau hana prices.
  
  Website Idea: The Happy Hour Finder would provide information on all available happy hours based on the time and the users' location. The information for each restaurant's happy hour will be stored in a database. The various pages included on the website are tenatively as follows:

-Home Page
-Restaurant Information Form Page
-Admin Page

Use case ideas:
  The method we plan to use to accumalate data is either scouring the web to find the various happy hour times or allowing restaurant owners/staff to input their restaurant's information. This can be applied by setting up various permissions and roles for the users, i.e. restaurant owners will have the permission to edit the information for their page. Another option is allowing all users to edit and update the pages so that the information is constantly updated by the userbase. The second option can lead to issues with the accuracy of the data but would ensure that the information would be updated more frequently and users will be able to add information on their favorite restaurants they would like to keep track of. We will be focusing on promoting local businesses and avoiding the inclusion of large chain brands. Lastly we will also need to include a large warning message upon opening the app indicating that the purchase of alcoholic beverages is restricted to those under the age of 21.

Beyond the basics:
This Project aims to bring the UH community together by facillitating gathering as a group to help them decompress and bond after school/work. Happy hour offers cheaper prices of not only alcoholic beverages but also food. We also are planning to promote local business and hopefully bring more patrons to struggling businesses.
