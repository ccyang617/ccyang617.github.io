### I. Introduction
  AI is prevalent in our curriculum, the news, and the proffesional world. We can see the effects AI are having on major aspects of our lives, especially as students in Computer Engineering/ Computer Science. Throughout this semester we have utilized AI tools to assist us in our coding projects and it has changed the learning algorithm for humans. I find myself constantly looking to AI as a useful resource when first learning a subject as well as when developing a long programming project. This course has also taught us the many dangers of relying too heavily on AI and has shown examples where AI fails to provide accurate information. This shows AI can be a very useful tool if used correctly but users should be wary of how they use it and always fact check their answers.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
       During these Experience WODS I often would not use AI because often these WODS served as tutorials. These tutorials were easy to accomplish on my own without the need of AI assistance and played an important part in my learning algorithm. By going through these problems without any AI assistance I was able to problem solve and work through any misunderstandings from the lesson. This also allowed me to practice important coding habits such as committing early and often as well as setting up my coding environment. I believe it is important to utilize your brain while learning because working through a solution sticks with me longer than reading one.

  3. In-class Practice WODs
       For the In-class Practice WODs I would use AI in order to speed up my coding process. The lessons I learned in the Experience WODs played a large role in showing me what I needed to do to accomplish these tasks. Due to having an understanding of the solution, it was easy to ask AI assistants such as ChatGPT to write simple code blocks for me in order to reduce the coding time. This is important because the true In-Class WODs that would determine a large portion of our grade is timed. Less coding time means a higher probability to succeed in this course so the application felt natural to make.

  5. In-class WODs
       The In-class WODs were similar to the practice WODs but with added rigor. This did not pose a large issue for me because of the coding practices I developed during the practice WODs. Using AI to write my simple blocks of code I can then use in my programs allowed me to succeed in many of the In-class WODs.

  7. Essays
       In my time I have had many professors and TA's instruct that the use of ChatGPT in essays would be forbidden. Due to this I like to restrict the use of AI in essays for research purposes. AI is a LLM and actually excels at speech and writing abilities, but it is also able to almost instantly reference thousands of documents. This makes AI a great research tool because of its speed, unfortunately often the information provided was either redundant or incorrectly applied. This did not cause much of an issue because I often used AI as a starting point of my research to gain background and general information.

  9. Final project
        AI was an integral part of the my work on the final project. A month is not a lot of time to fully develop a working website with your peers and apply the various lessons throughout the semester. Often my team members and I needed to refresh on concepts that we have not re-visited for some time. AI was a very helpful tool when it came to refreshing our memory on topics we have not used recently. AI also provided great insight when looking into coding examples or debugging our own code. I often would ask AI to trace my code if I was having issues or explain certain errors I was receiving in the console.

  11. Learning a concept / tutorial
        I have not used AI when learning a concept or using a tutorial. I have used it to refresh my memory on concepts and summarize tutorials when referencing back to topics. It is a great too to sum things up and help get to the information you are specifically looking for.

  13. Answering a question in class or in Discord
        For a few group class exercises we used AI to answer various questions and compare the results with one another. Often one side of the class would use AI and the other would use traditional methods such as researching through Google. Most recently we discussed software engineering ethics using AI and it provided some good answers and some insufficient answers. Ethics and morality as concepts are difficult to program as there are almost no absolutes in ethics. Ethics can vary based on people and professions. For example, professional engineers in all fields are held to a responsibility to the well-being of the public, but business ethics are held to a responsibility to their share-holders. This conflict often leads to battles between high-level management and their engineers as their ethical standards are in disagreement. AI is simply not at a stage where it can correctly and safely identify the correct ethical solution to all problems.

  15. Asking or answering a smart-question
        I have not used AI to ask or answer a smart-question, I often reference websites such as stack-overflow and other techinical forums. Here many of the answers to our questions can be found and even solutions that do not match perfectly to our situations can give information to solve issues.

  17. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
        Sometimes code documentation can provide little information on syntax or the way some functions work without looking into the libraries where the functions are defined. Fortunately for us most of the resources we have used in class are all very well documented and easy to use. During my final project I often asked ChatGPT to remind me of the syntax of a certain statement or its parameters. I also often used the code documentation to help me understand how to use the functions. Either way seems equally useful, the use of AI can sometimes speed up the process but when I was really stuck I always had to look further into the documentation.

  19. Explaining code
        When explaining code AI works sufficiently to sum up what is going on. Sometimes variable names can influence how the AI interperets the code and it provides an unreliable answer. This can be remedied by giving the AI additional prompts explaining the issues and it will sometimes fix itself. I often used AI in tandem with the code documentation to understand how to use certain functions in specific libraries. 

  21. Writing code
        When writing code AI excels with simple problems, making it perfect for solving sub-problems using dynamic programming. As problems get more difficult, AI gets less accurate and often has trouble combining multiple concepts into one working program. AI is not great at understanding how data is passed between two components and sometimes struggles to output the correct solution. AI should be used as a starting point for code but it is important that the programmer still understands how to fix the issues and is comfortable with all the practices used by the AI. Often the solution is sufficient if you can fix the variables and the way data is assigned.

  23. Documenting code
        AI provides more comments than I ever do while programming, but often the comments are simple and non-descript. This is not typically an issue as simple and clear comments can be the best way to document the program. Sometimes the comments can be very unhelpful because the AI cannot properly explain the process that is happening and opts for a short and broad answer.

  25. Quality assurance
        I use AI to ensure the quality of my essays often. Using AI to help correct grammatical errors and shorten papers is very useful. If I have ever written over the limit in one of my papers all it takes is inputting my words into an AI assistant and typically it removes all of the filler words.
